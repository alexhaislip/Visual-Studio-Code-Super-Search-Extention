ADDED June, 2018:

As of v1.24 you can do the same for the replace terms:

Replace term history in Search view

You can now navigate to your previous replace terms in the Search View.

Alt+Up navigates backward in the history.

Corresponding command is search.replaceHistory.showPrevious.

Alt+Down navigates forward in the history.

Corresponding command is search.replaceHistory.showNext.
